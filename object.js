            This project taught a number of lessons as follows.
            Learning to use Firebase was a fairly simple task and allowed safe global storage of information.
            In addition to being a great place to store data Firebase also offers a secure method of user authentication.
            This allows for small sites to have users who feel safe when logging in.
            Lastly this project shows a firm understanding of React and component based coding.
            My main hurdle with this project was using async functions to allow items to render after the information is loaded from Firebase.
            For the most part Iâ€™ve managed to avoid async functions but it was essential for this project.`,
